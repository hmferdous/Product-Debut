# Premise
The COVID-19 pandemic is the ultimate reality check for the Bangladeshi Healthcare Sector. 
While the country is entangled in fighting the pandemic for almost four months now, the fact that we were hilariously 
outmanned to keep up with this threat from the beginning, has never been clearer. 
According to a blog published in the World Bank Blogs in April 2020, individual healthcare systems and UHC of the countries 
are what will set the ultimate difference between each country's response to this pandemic. 
At the 64th World Health Assembly in May 2011, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the Government of Bangladesh announced that 
Bangladesh will achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2032. 
While Bangladesh had an outstanding performance in achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of 
reducing maternal, infant, and under-five mortality rates between 1990 and 2015, in the tenth year since its commence, 
we are still far from achieving UHC under the 3rd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). 
With an increasing percentage of out-of-pocket expenditure in total health expenditure every year, 
it is now time to ask ourselves the million-dollar question: “Is Bangladesh going to achieve UHC within 2032?”

# What is UHC?
According to the World Health Organization: “UHC means that all individuals and communities receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. 
It includes the full spectrum of essential, quality health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.”
According to this definition, we can say that the main two aspects of  UHC are-
1. **population-wide service coverage** 
2. **financial protection** against the high levels of healthcare expenditure.

# Why does Bangladesh need UHC?
More often than not, the people of Bangladesh are forced to make a trade-off between their wellbeing and financial stability. It is almost impossible for the most vulnerable section of our population to stay financially solvent and also receive the quality level of preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative health services that they need. In order to bridge this gap and bring about economic and social equity and stability, we need UHC in Bangladesh. 

## Economic and Social Stability
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) can help Bangladesh build a much-needed platform for sustainable and inclusive growth. If we look at Japan, who celebrated their 50 years of achieving UHC in 2011, we will see that their commitment to UHC played a definitive role in the country’s economic and social recovery in the post–World War II period, when the country was in shambles. Their commitment also helped the country to develop a vibrant middle class and secure social stability. UHC in Bangladesh will help us ensure that the benefits of the ongoing economic growth are being shared equitably across the population.
The financial protection that UHC will provide will benefit the country’s economy considering the fact that it will prevent the backlash received from the increasing out-of-pocket expenditure in the health sector. Bangladesh has the highest out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure, 74%, among the South Asian countries.

## Equity and Sustainability
UHC in Bangladesh will help us ensure that the benefits of the ongoing economic growth are being shared equitably across the population. It is the ultimate health funding policy that builds upon equity, efficiency, and effectiveness, and gallantly ensures that the basic rights of our most vulnerable people are established. By providing substantial financial security, UHC will impact our society by promoting job creation, alleviating poverty, promoting peripheral economic inclusion, and strengthening the country's health security and thus macro-stability.

# UHC Activities in Bangladesh 
In the 9 years since the official announcement, the country has seen several projects in tandem with the UHC objective. In the public sector of Bangladesh, a number of activities are undertaken. Essential Services Package or, ESP is considered the basis of all UHC activities in this sector. Shasthyo Suroksha Karmasuchi (SSK) is a pilot health-financing scheme produced by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) of the Government of Bangladesh. Among the other programs there are:
- Social and Behavioral Change Communications (SBCC)
- Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)
- Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)
- Emergency Obstetric Care (EOC)

Although from the outside it seems that our country has made some sort of progress in the first goal of UHC, that is, population-wide service coverage, a closer look will reveal the true scenario. Most of our healthcare system’s development is due to the Government’s previous commitment to the MDG goal. In the Health Facility Survey of 2015, basic healthcare amenities in the district-and-below level public and private facilities were inadequate. Only a meager 25% of all such facilities had the 6 basic healthcare tools, a list WHO and USAID propose for basic health services namely: stethoscope, thermometer, blood pressure apparatus, adult weighing scale, child or infant scale, and a light source.
As for the second objective of increasing financial protection against costly healthcare services, Bangladesh shows a very sorry picture. With 74% out-of-pocket payments and 7% of the households pushing towards the poverty line because of it, it is safe to say we are still a long way from achieving UHC.

# Barriers to Achieving UHC in Bangladesh
UHC faces a multitude of challenges in Bangladesh in terms of socio-economic conditions, policy-making, and implementation. A brief description follows:
## Socio-Economic Challenges
A significant portion of the Muslim population of Bangladesh is still under the impression that health insurance is a violation of their religious belief according to Dr. Joarder, 2018. His research also illustrates the pervasive lack of societal trust, coupled with a lack of historical precedence to insurance mechanisms as the chief hindrance to convince people to pay the government for health insurance. 
Another barrier that the policy-makers are likely to face is the perpetual knowledge gap of the general mass regarding UHC. Since the people are not accustomed to prepayment for their health expenditure in the future, except in some cases like the government employees, it can be a daunting task to convince people to pay for a cost that still hasn't been incurred. Moreover, all over the world, a common misconception about UHC is that the government will completely cover the costs of all types of quality treatment. In reality, it is hardly true. Therefore, it only gets increasingly harder to persuade the mass people about UHC and its benefits when the benefits are mostly long term.
## Challenges Faced due to Weak Healthcare Infrastructure
One of the main challenges of implementing UHC is identifying and establishing treatment facilities in the hard-to-reach areas of our country. But an undermanned healthcare system that is too focused on the cities obstructs the flow of services to these areas. Lack of proper Human Resource Monitoring and Development, understaffed and under-equipped facilities, corruption in virtually every sector of the public health, and the perpetual lack of accountability have riddled our healthcare system with weaknesses.
The problem of the seemingly weak infrastructure of our healthcare is further exacerbated by the lack of government funding every year. Bangladesh has a large number of ethnic groups and minorities, thanks to its diverse nature and origin, which requires the healthcare system to have a flexible budget to ensure proper services in all areas such as the hill tracts, the tea gardens, border areas, etc. But the persistent lack of Government Budget allocation is a major hindrance in this regard.

## Challenges in Policy-Making
The Government of Bangladesh follows a supply-side budgeting method where the various ministries of the government are connected in an intricate system. Changing the composition of budget allocation in one of the ministries creates a subsequent change in others as well (Joarder, 2018). Moreover, a highly centralized public system like ours makes it increasingly difficult to ensure transparency and accountability across all levels.
Implementation of UHC is a costly process without any doubt. The chronic lack of required budget also hinders the policymakers to take any effective and efficient actions.
With a growing economy like ours, where people’s purchasing power parity is on the rise, it is only natural that people are more willing than before to spend large sums completely out-of-pocket for achieving better health. This also indicates our rising out-of-pocket expense in healthcare. 

# Mitigation Strategies for Challenges in Implementing UHC in Bangladesh

1. **Strengthening Health Financing**  
   Bangladesh must allocate a higher proportion of GDP to healthcare, aiming for at least 5% as per WHO recommendations. Progressive taxation can be introduced to generate sustainable funding for universal health coverage (UHC). Additionally, partnerships with international organizations like the WHO, World Bank, and ADB can bring in grants and expertise. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) should be leveraged to fund large-scale infrastructure projects and expand service delivery.

2. **Building Healthcare Infrastructure**  
   A robust network of primary healthcare facilities is essential to ensure equitable access. Investments should focus on upgrading existing rural clinics, equipping them with diagnostic tools, and ensuring a consistent supply of essential medicines. Expanding telemedicine services can bridge geographical gaps, providing remote consultations and follow-ups. Further, transport infrastructure must be developed to facilitate timely patient referrals, particularly in underserved regions.

3. **Addressing Workforce Gaps**  
   Scaling up the healthcare workforce is critical. This involves increasing the capacity of medical and nursing institutions to produce more skilled professionals. Rural deployment can be incentivized through financial rewards, career advancement opportunities, and improved living conditions. Regular training programs and workshops must also be conducted to keep healthcare workers updated on new technologies and practices.

4. **Policy and Governance Improvements**  
   Strong governance is key to the success of UHC. Clear and enforceable policies should be formulated, prioritizing equity and quality. Transparent monitoring and evaluation mechanisms must track resource allocation and outcomes. Engaging communities in healthcare planning can ensure policies are tailored to local needs and challenges. Enhanced accountability measures will prevent corruption and inefficiencies in the system.

5. **Promoting Preventive and Community Health**  
   Preventive healthcare should be emphasized to reduce the burden on curative services. This includes strengthening vaccination programs, launching early disease detection initiatives, and promoting healthy lifestyles to address the rise in non-communicable diseases. Nationwide health education campaigns can raise awareness about UHC benefits and encourage greater utilization of healthcare services. Special focus on maternal and child health can improve overall community well-being.

By addressing these key areas, Bangladesh can overcome the challenges of UHC implementation and create a system that ensures equitable and quality healthcare for all citizens.
