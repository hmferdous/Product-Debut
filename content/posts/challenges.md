Product management is a multidisciplinary role, requiring a blend of technical, strategic, and interpersonal skills. For product managers coming from a **business background* like me, the transition into this complex role can be rewarding yet challenging. While our strengths in strategy and stakeholder management are invaluable, navigating the technical aspects of the role can pose unique hurdles.

Here’s a closer look at the challenges I faced as a business-background product managers and how I overcame them.

## 1. **Understanding Technical Concepts**

One of the most common challenges is bridging the gap in technical knowledge. I often need to collaborate with developers, understand APIs, database structures, and system workflows. For someone without prior technical exposure, this can feel daunting.

### **How I Overcame It**
- Taking foundational courses in **software development**, **databases**, or **APIs** on coursera and Udemy to build a working understanding of the basics.
- Developed strong connections with my tech team and CTO. Whenever I felt out of depth, I went to my CTO who had beeen a blessing to my journey in Product Management. Having a CTO is a great plus but doesnt mean you cant work with 
- Looking up any and all tech jargons I hear in the meetings. Really helped me in future interactions with tech team as I grasped the concepts faster with each meeting.

## 2. **Winning Trust from Technical Teams**

Without a technical background, gaining credibility with engineers can be a challenge. As I worked with 2 external and one internal tech teams, I am constantly questioned whether I adequately defined the product requirements or assessed the feasibility of solutions.

### **How to Overcome It**
- Using product frameworks like **User Stories** and **Acceptance Criteria** to provide clear requirements which are easier for the tech teams to see through.
- Stay involved in discussions to show I am engaged and learning from every interactions I have with them.

## 3. **Balancing Technical Depth with Strategic Vision**

Business-background product managers often excel in the **why** of a product but struggle with the **how**. While strategic vision is critical to me and my team, an understanding of the technical side is equally important to assess feasibility and timelines which needs to be communicated with senior management eventually.

### **How to Overcome It**
- Partnering closely with tech and QA leads to co-create roadmaps and estimates. As we worked with external vendors mostly it also helped us create feasible plans for product launches if we were all on the same page
- Use analogies and frameworks (e.g., **the Double Diamond**) to align our team's strategic vision with technical execution.

## 4. **Adapting to Agile Workflows**

Adapting to **Agile methodologies** can be a steep learning curve. Agile emphasizes iterative development, constant feedback, and rapid change—contrasting with long-term planning often seen in business roles.

### **How to Overcome It**
- Study the basics of Agile, including frameworks like **Scrum** and **Kanban**.
- Observe and learn by actively participating in Agile ceremonies like **standups**, **retrospectives**, and **sprint planning**.
- Focus on delivering **MVPs (Minimum Viable Products)** and iterating based on user feedback.

## 5. **Navigating Data and Analytics**

Business-background professionals are typically familiar with high-level metrics, but product management requires a deeper dive into **user behavior analytics** and **conversion funnels**. The challenge lies in turning raw data into actionable insights.

### **How to Overcome It**
- Learn data tools like **Google Analytics**, **Mixpanel**, or **Tableau** to extract and visualize data.
- Focus on metrics that matter: adoption rates, churn, retention, and user engagement.
- Collaborate with data teams to ensure your insights are grounded in robust analysis.

Remember, **product management is a journey**, and every challenge is an opportunity to grow.
