*This is more of a note than an article, a culmination of what I am learning by scouring the internet.*  

As a product manager, one of the most critical skills I've developed over the last year is the ability to balance **user experience (UX)** with **business acumen**. Both elements are crucial for building products that not only meet user needs but also drive business growth. Here’s how I approach this balance:

### **Understanding User Needs and Business Goals**  
At the core of every product decision is the need to serve both the **user** and the **business**. A product with great UX but poor alignment with business objectives (i.e, the bottom line) may not sustain itself in the market. Conversely, a business-driven product (*sighs in Pocket*)that neglects the user’s needs will struggle to gain traction.

I always start by empathizing with the **user**—conducting user interviews starting from my colleagues who are the primary users of my prodcut, gathering feedback, and analyzing behavioral data. Simultaneously, I ensure that I have a strong grasp of the **business goals**, whether it’s increasing user engagement, reducing operational costs, or enhancing revenue streams (*again, the bottom line*).  

By understanding the overlap between these two, I can prioritize features that both improve user experience and contribute to business objectives.

### **Prototyping and Feedback Loops**  
To strike the right balance, I rely on **rapid prototyping** and **iterative feedback**. Creating low-fidelity prototypes in Whimsical allows me to quickly test user-facing features, gather real feedback, and refine the product without investing too much time or resources upfront. This keeps the product development process agile, ensuring both **UX improvements** and **business goals** evolve together.

Feedback from users, whether it’s from testing or post-launch reviews, is essential for shaping the product further. This process is crucial in building features that users actually want, while also ensuring the product's success in the market. This post-rlaunch findings actually shape my backlog in a meaningful manner rather than making it a god-forsaken swirling vortex of products and feaures that no PM would touch with a 10 feet pole.

### **The Intersection of UX and Business in Decision Making**  
In many cases, there may be trade-offs between the two — such as adding a feature that would delight users but could be costly for the business to implement. In these cases, I rely on **data** to guide decisions. Metrics like **transaction success rate** and **DAU-MAU** often provide the insights needed to find a compromise.

At the end of it all, only through effective collaboration with design, tech, and business teams, we can arrive at solutions that meet both user expectations and business needs.
