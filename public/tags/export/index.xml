      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine losing a country’s chief economic driving force, built up over a span of four decades, in just three months. This is what the COVID-19 pandemic was going to do to Bangladesh, or at least threatening to, when USD 3.18 Billion worth of orders were canceled in March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Readymade Garments industry has been the country’s backbone for some time now. The sector alone accounts for 84% of the country’s export earnings. This kind of massive overdependence on only one industry has threatened to cripple Bangladesh’s economy once before in 2013 when the structural failure of a local factory in Dhaka resulted in the tragic loss of 1,134 lives. The government and industry regulators were under a lot of pressure to make sure that the ongoing pandemic does not result in another parade of lost lives like that again. The wide range of panic and confusion among both the government and industry stakeholders regarding whether to reopen the factories was both understandable and justifiable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
