      <title>Worker Health Safety During COVID-19 in Bangladesh</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine losing a country’s chief economic driving force, built up over a span of four decades, in just three months. This is what the COVID-19 pandemic was going to do to Bangladesh, or at least threatening to, when USD 3.18 Billion worth of orders were canceled in March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Readymade Garments industry has been the country’s backbone for some time now. The sector alone accounts for 84% of the country’s export earnings. This kind of massive overdependence on only one industry has threatened to cripple Bangladesh’s economy once before in 2013 when the structural failure of a local factory in Dhaka resulted in the tragic loss of 1,134 lives. The government and industry regulators were under a lot of pressure to make sure that the ongoing pandemic does not result in another parade of lost lives like that again. The wide range of panic and confusion among both the government and industry stakeholders regarding whether to reopen the factories was both understandable and justifiable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Universal Health Coverage: A Bangladeshi Perspective</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;premise&#34;&gt;Premise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic is the ultimate reality check for the Bangladeshi Healthcare Sector.
While the country is entangled in fighting the pandemic for almost four months now, the fact that we were hilariously
outmanned to keep up with this threat from the beginning, has never been clearer.
According to a blog published in the World Bank Blogs in April 2020, individual healthcare systems and UHC of the countries
are what will set the ultimate difference between each country&amp;rsquo;s response to this pandemic.
At the 64th World Health Assembly in May 2011, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the Government of Bangladesh announced that
Bangladesh will achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2032.
While Bangladesh had an outstanding performance in achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of
reducing maternal, infant, and under-five mortality rates between 1990 and 2015, in the tenth year since its commence,
we are still far from achieving UHC under the 3rd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).
With an increasing percentage of out-of-pocket expenditure in total health expenditure every year,
it is now time to ask ourselves the million-dollar question: “Is Bangladesh going to achieve UHC within 2032?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
